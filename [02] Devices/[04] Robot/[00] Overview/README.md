# Robot
## Summary
This is a robot based on the Robot PCB. It is designed to be controlled with the
JoystickController device. The joystick controls the movement using tank controls, and 
optionally controls a claw.
Clicking both joystick buttons switches the robot into autonomous mode: it will look
for and execute code in the run_code.py file.

## Uses
- Claw Components
- ServoBase Component


## TODO
- Perhaps configuration scheme to make claw or other add-on optional
